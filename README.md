# mathscript
mathscript is a javascript library for converting simple mathscript expressions into MathML HTML elements.

this is originally a school project for maths class, and it is going to be far from perfect for a long time. i will try to keep maintaining this script, but i cannot guarantee updates until the end of time :)
thanks for understanding!
